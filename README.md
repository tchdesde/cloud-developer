# Exploring US Bike Share Data
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems of three major cities â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I wrote the code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
